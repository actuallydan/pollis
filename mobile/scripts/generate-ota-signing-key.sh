# The certificate is compiled into every prod build (app.config.js,
# `updates.codeSigningCertificate`); the app then refuses any OTA manifest not
# signed by the private key. The key lives in exactly one place that can use
# it: the `ota-signing` GitHub environment (required reviewer), as the
# environment secret OTA_CODE_SIGNING_KEY, synced from Doppler. It is never on
# the update server (updates.pollis.com only passes pre-signed bytes through).
#
# Uses `expo-updates codesigning:generate` (the expo-updates the app ships), so
# the certificate carries exactly the extensions the app's verifier demands:
# keyUsage digitalSignature, extKeyUsage codeSigning.
#
# Rotating = a new key AND a new store build carrying the new certificate;
# phones on older builds keep trusting only the old one. See mobile/CLAUDE.md
# "OTA updates" and docs/signing-key-compromise-runbook.md.

Next, in this order:

  1. Store the PRIVATE KEY in Doppler (project pollis, config prd_prod):
       doppler secrets set OTA_CODE_SIGNING_KEY -p pollis -c prd_prod < "${KEY_DIR}/private-key.pem"
     Doppler must sync it ONLY to the GitHub environment \`ota-signing\`
     (Settings → Environments → ota-signing: required reviewer = you, deployment
     branches/tags = main + mobile-ota-*), as the environment secret
     OTA_CODE_SIGNING_KEY — never as a repository secret.
  2. Keep an offline copy (1Password, like the sideload keystore), then delete
     ${KEY_DIR}/private-key.pem from this machine.
  3. Commit mobile/store/ota-code-signing.pem — the public certificate only — and record the
     cert SHA-256 above in the PR. Every store build after that commit can take
     OTA updates; builds before it never will.

Never commit the private key; mobile/.gitignore ignores *.pem except the certificate.
