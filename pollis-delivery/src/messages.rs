//! Domain A — message envelopes, edits/deletes, reactions, watermarks, and
//! attachment dedup rows. The **reference vertical slice** for Goal B (#419):
//! every later write-domain (B/C/D) copies the shape established here.
//!
//! ## The per-domain convention (copy this)
//!
//!   - **Bodies** — one `#[derive(Deserialize)] *Body` per endpoint. Binary
//!     fields are base64 (STANDARD); everything else is plain JSON. (Domain A
//!     has no binary fields — `ciphertext` is already the `"mls:<hex>"` text the
//!     client stores, and content hashes / R2 keys are text.)
//!   - **Pure conn-level fns** — `apply_*` functions take a bare
//!     [`Connection`], the authenticated user (`Option<&str>`; `None` only on
//!     the no-auth path), and a parsed `*Body`. They embed BOTH the
//!     authorization decision AND the write, returning [`WriteOutcome`]. Putting
//!     authz inside the pure fn (rather than the axum handler, as `writes.rs`
//!     does) is deliberate: it makes the in-process test harness exercise the
//!     *exact* same authz the production handler runs, with zero duplication —
//!     both call sites are reduced to `gate → parse → apply → map outcome`.
//!   - **axum handlers** — `(State, Method, Uri, HeaderMap, Bytes) -> Response`,
//!     all identical in shape. They `gate` (shared auth, see
//!     [`crate::writes::gate`]), parse, call the matching `apply_*`, and map the
//!     outcome to 200 / 403 / 400 / 500.
//!
//! ## Where the writes land
//!
//! Every domain-A table lives in the **MAIN DB** (`state.db`), NOT the commit-log
//! DB — these are message-delivery rows, not MLS control-plane rows. So all
//! `apply_*` fns run on the main connection.
//!
//! ## Authorization (the security core)
//!
//! `gate` proves *which user* signed the request; each `apply_*` then proves the
//! user is *allowed* to make that specific write:
//!   - send / edit / delete: the user is a current member of the conversation
//!     (reusing [`crate::writes::is_member`]). Authorship is NOT checked here
//!     (Solution A, #607): under unconditional sealed sender the stored
//!     `sender_id` is a blinded sentinel, so the DS cannot prove who authored a
//!     message. Edit/self-delete are membership-gated only; the author check that
//!     used to live here is enforced CLIENT-side on ingest (the edit/redaction's
//!     MLS-authenticated credential must equal the target's author). Admin-delete
//!     still additionally requires the user be a group admin of the channel's
//!     owning group (a permission check, not an author check).
//!   - reactions: the user is a member, and may only write/remove their OWN
//!     reaction (`user_id` is bound to the authenticated user).
//!   - watermark: the row is per `(conversation, user, device)`; the user may
//!     only advance their own.
//!   - envelope GC: the deletion *decision* is many-member correct regardless of
//!     who triggers it — bounded by the MIN watermark over the whole current
//!     member-device roster, and by device liveness (#720: a device silent past
//!     N months stops pinning), but never by wall-clock message age (invariant
//!     I3). The *trigger* is the DS-internal sweep [`sweep_envelope_gc`] (#689),
//!     not a member's ingest path; the per-conversation [`apply_envelope_gc`]
//!     endpoint runs the same watermark-gated cleanup for one conversation on
//!     demand.
//!   - attachment references (#690): releasing a reference is NOT a gated
//!     endpoint at all — the reference count is DERIVED from envelope existence
//!     (`attachment_ref ⋈ message_envelope`, see [`live_ref_exists`]), so the
//!     only way to release one is to delete its message envelope through the
//!     already-authorized delete/GC/teardown paths above. `/v1/attachments/
//!     register` and `/v1/attachments/delete` need only prove a real device:
//!     the former adds a declaration that counts only against a live envelope, the
//!     latter merely collects an already-unreferenced object.
//!
//! On the no-auth path (`authed == None`, only reachable when the DS runs with
//! `POLLIS_DS_REQUIRE_AUTH` off) the membership/identity checks are skipped and
//! the actor comes from the body — mirroring `commit::submit` and `writes.rs`.

// ── Envelope GC SQL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Envelope cleanup is gated on the DELIVERY WATERMARK: a row is deleted only when
// its `sent_at` sits strictly below the MINIMUM `last_fetched_at` over every
// current member device of the conversation that is still LIVE. Retention is
// bounded by the slowest LIVE member device — never by wall-clock message age.
// This is invariant I3 ("no TTL") in `docs/backend-core-invariants.md`.
//
// There used to be a second, OR'd arm: `sent_at < datetime('now', '-30 days')`.
// Because it was OR'd it deleted ON ITS OWN, without consulting a single
// watermark — so encrypted mail that no recipient device had ever collected was
// destroyed 30 days after it was sent, and a device offline for longer than that
// silently and permanently lost messages. That is failure mode F3, and it broke
// the product's headline guarantee (a member receives every message sent while
// they were a member; the only acceptable losses are pre-join history and a
// brand-new empty device). The arm is gone. Do not reintroduce a time-based — or
// any other delivery-blind — deletion gate here: age is not evidence of delivery.
//
// ## The device-liveness bound (#720, WS1)
//
// Without more, a device that installs, joins a busy group and never opens the
// app again pins that conversation's envelopes forever: its `last_fetched_at`
// never advances, so it holds `MIN(cw)` down indefinitely. #720 bounds this by
// LIVENESS — a member device that has not REPORTED a watermark in N months stops
// counting toward the gate (the `?2` staleness arm below; N is the `?2` modifier,
// set to 12 months in both deployed environments — see
// `DEFAULT_WATERMARK_STALE_MODIFIER`). It mirrors the revoked-device exclusion (#685): a
// stale device is filtered out of the roster the gate measures against, exactly
// as a revoked one is.
//
// The bound is on the device's own LAST REPORT (`cw.reported_at`, a wall-clock
// timestamp the DS stamps on every watermark write), NEVER on `last_fetched_at`
// (a message-cursor value) or the envelope's `sent_at`. That distinction is the
// whole point: a device that reported yesterday pins EVERY envelope below its
// cursor no matter how old the envelope is (anti-F3). Reusing `last_fetched_at`
// or `sent_at` for staleness would resurrect F3 — a live device in a quiet
// conversation legitimately carries an old cursor without being dormant.
//
// This makes envelope retention bounded by member watermarks AND by device
// liveness — a strictly SMALLER bound than the commit log's, whose stale-device
// case is instead handled by its Tier-2 hard cap (`commit::prune_floor`). The
// consequence is a THIRD accepted loss (beyond pre-join history and a new empty
// device): a device dormant past N months that returns may find gaps. This is a
// deliberate storage/correctness trade, gated behind a conservative N; see
// invariant I3 and `docs/metadata-retention-policy.md` §1.
//
// It fails CLOSED on `reported_at IS NULL`: a device with NO watermark row (a
// LEFT JOIN miss — brand-new, never synced) and a pre-migration row whose
// `reported_at` was never stamped both read NULL and are KEPT in the roster (they
// pin), because unknown report time is not evidence of dormancy. Only a device
// with a KNOWN report time older than the window is excluded.
//
// What remains fails CLOSED on every edge:
//   * `COUNT(ud.device_id) = COUNT(cw.last_fetched_at)` — every current member
//     device must have REPORTED a watermark. The LEFT JOIN yields NULL for a
//     device with no `conversation_watermark` row and `COUNT` skips NULLs, so a
//     never-reported device (brand-new, or long absent) breaks the equality, the
//     CASE returns NULL, and `sent_at < NULL` is NULL — nothing is deleted.
//   * `MIN(cw.last_fetched_at)` — the floor is the SLOWEST reporter's cursor, so
//     one eager device racing ahead cannot raise it.
//   * an EMPTY member-device set aggregates to `COUNT 0 = COUNT 0` with
//     `MIN(...) = NULL` over zero rows, so the CASE again returns NULL. A roster
//     that resolves to nobody is not evidence that everybody collected.
//
// The member-device roster is filtered by `ud.revoked_at IS NULL` (#685): a
// revoked device can never rejoin the MLS tree (I5), so it must not count toward
// the roster the watermark gate is measured against — otherwise it holds the
// floor down forever. Without the filter a revoked device wedges cleanup in
// either direction: its stale `last_fetched_at` pins `MIN(cw)` to a dead cursor,
// or its missing row breaks the "every device reported" check and disables
// pruning outright. This mirrors `commit::current_member_devices`, which excludes
// revoked devices from the commit-log retention floor for the same reason — keep
// the two rosters in agreement (I5).
//
// ## Why the roster lives in a macro (#722)
//
// The roster — "which member devices does the watermark gate measure against" —
// is the SAME rule in three places: these two DELETEs and
// [`crate::commit::current_member_devices`]. Nothing structural forces them to
// agree, and a divergence is an I5 violation surfacing as dropped mail (a roster
// too small deletes what a device still needs) or wedged retention (a roster too
// large never clears). So the join chain each DELETE aggregates over is factored
// out into a macro expanding to a string literal, and `concat!`-ed back into the
// statement — the SQL the DS executes is byte-for-byte what it always was, but
// the *roster half* of it now has exactly one definition that the parity test in
// `roster_parity_tests` can SELECT from directly. Editing the roster inside the
// DELETE now necessarily edits what the test reads, so any drift away from the
// Rust roster shows up as a red test rather than as silent divergence.
//
// The fragments deliberately include the `LEFT JOIN conversation_watermark`: it
// is what `COUNT(ud.device_id)` is counted over, so `SELECT ud.device_id` +
// fragment is *precisely* the row set the gate aggregates — including any
// accidental fan-out — not a paraphrase of it.

/// The channel roster: every non-revoked device of every member of the group
/// that owns channel `?1`, LEFT JOINed to that device's watermark for `?1`.

// ## The `?2` device-liveness (staleness) arm, and why it lives OUTSIDE the macro
//
// The staleness filter (`cw.reported_at IS NULL OR cw.reported_at >=
// datetime('now', ?2)`) is appended to each DELETE *around* the shared roster
// fragment, NOT inside it. This is deliberate and load-bearing for the I5 roster
// parity (see `roster_parity_tests`): the roster macro is the ONE definition of
// "which member devices exist" shared with `commit::current_member_devices`, and
// the commit log applies NO liveness bound (it uses its own Tier-2 hard cap). If
// staleness went inside the macro, the envelope roster and the commit roster
// would diverge and the parity test would (correctly) fail. Keeping it outside
// leaves the shared roster byte-for-byte identical — the parity SELECTs read the
// pure roster — while the envelope DELETE applies liveness as an ADDITIONAL,
// envelope-only filter on top of that roster. The channel fragment has no `WHERE`
// so the arm opens one; the DM fragment already ends in `WHERE dcm.dm_channel_id
// = ?1` so the arm is `AND`-ed onto it.
//
// `?2` is a SQLite datetime modifier (e.g. `'-6 months'`), computed in Rust from
// config (`watermark_stale_modifier`). Both the sweep and the per-conversation
// endpoint bind the same value through the one chokepoint
// `cleanup_conversation_envelopes`, so the two GC paths can never apply different
// predicates (#720 checkbox 3).

//
// A DS-stamped tombstone is only ever fetched if it sorts strictly ABOVE the
// recipient's `conversation_watermark.last_fetched_at`: ingest selects
// `sent_at > last_fetched_at` (strictly greater) and advances the cursor to the
// highest `sent_at` it consumed, so the cursor NEVER rewinds and anything
// stamped at or below it is skipped permanently, not merely delayed
// (`pollis_core::commands::messages::ingest`).
//
// The floor is therefore the highest cursor value any recipient could already
// hold, and it has TWO sources — one of which outlives the other:
//
//   * `MAX(sent_at)` over `message_envelope` — the conversation's high-water
//     mark, but only over envelopes STILL PRESENT. Envelope GC deletes rows once
//     every current member device has reported a watermark past them (see
//     `CLEANUP_*` above; since #688 that deletion is purely watermark-gated, with
//     no TTL arm to bound it). Once a conversation has been fully pruned this
//     side is NULL.
//   * `MAX(last_fetched_at)` over `conversation_watermark` — the highest cursor
//     actually reported for the conversation. These rows are NOT touched by
//     envelope GC; they are only ever advanced (monotone UPSERT in
//     `apply_advance_watermark`) or deleted with the device itself
//     (`apply_revoke_device`). They therefore SURVIVE the pruning that empties
//     the envelope side.
//
// #692: using only the envelope side meant that once GC had pruned a
// conversation the floor went NULL, `sent_at_after` fell back to wall-clock
// `now`, and the clock-skew dependency this guard exists to remove was back — a
// recipient whose watermark came from a client clock running AHEAD of the DS
// clock would never fetch the tombstone, and the deleted message stayed readable
// on that device forever. The watermark side is precisely the evidence that
// survives GC, so the floor is the greater of the two.
//
// Expressed as one SQL statement rather than two queries max'd in Rust: each arm
// is an aggregate over a possibly-empty set, so each yields exactly one
// (possibly NULL) row, and the outer `MAX` skips NULLs — giving "greater of the
// two, or NULL when both are absent" with no Rust-side NULL bookkeeping and a

// A `(content_hash, message_id)` row in `attachment_ref` is a client DECLARATION
// — "message M carries the file with this hash" — but it only COUNTS while the
// message it names still exists, i.e. while a `message_envelope` row carries that
// id. The live count is therefore `attachment_ref` JOINed to `message_envelope`,
// never the raw `attachment_ref` rows.
//
// This is what makes the two blocking properties true by construction rather than
// by discipline:
//
//   * **A reference cannot outlive its message (Blocking 2).** EVERY path that
//     deletes an envelope — self/admin delete (`apply_delete_message`), the
//     watermark-gated GC sweep (#689, `cleanup_conversation_envelopes`), the
//     retention sweep (#720), account teardown (`account.rs`), group/profile
//     teardown (`groups.rs`/`profile.rs`), even a test harness — drops the join
//     partner and so releases the reference FOR FREE. Nothing has to remember to
//     release; release is the disappearance of the envelope, not a step any of
//     those N deleters performs. That is the #691 ELECTRON lesson applied: don't
//     ask three-plus deleters to each remember the same cleanup — make the
//     invariant derive so the next deleter cannot forget it.
//
//   * **Releasing a reference is not an unauthorized action (Blocking 1).**
//     Because the count is derived from envelope existence, the ONLY way to drop
//     it is to delete the envelope — which already goes through the
//     membership-gated (self) / admin-gated (moderation) `/v1/messages/delete`,
//     the server-internal sweeps, or account/group teardown. `/v1/attachments/
//     delete` no longer mutates `attachment_ref` at all (see
//     [`apply_delete_attachment`]), so a forged call naming another member's
//     `message_id` cannot strand anything: the referencing envelope still exists,
//     so the object stays referenced. The attack is removed structurally, not
//     access-checked.
//
// A declaration whose `message_id` names an envelope that never existed (a forged
// register) or has already gone simply never counts — it is inert, and reaped in

#[cfg(test)]
mod roster_parity_tests {
    //! **I5 — the three rosters must agree (#722).**
    //!
    //! "Which member devices count toward retention" is one rule with three
    //! implementations: [`CLEANUP_CHANNEL_ENVELOPES`], [`CLEANUP_DM_ENVELOPES`]
    //! (envelope GC, SQL) and [`crate::commit::current_member_devices`]
    //! (commit-log retention floor, Rust). #685/#686 brought them into agreement
    //! on revoked devices; nothing structural keeps them there. A divergence is
    //! not cosmetic:
    //!
    //!   * SQL roster **narrower** than the Rust one → envelope GC deletes mail a
    //!     device the commit log still serves has not collected (loss, F3-shaped).
    //!   * SQL roster **wider** → a device that cannot rejoin the tree holds the
    //!     watermark floor down forever and envelopes never clear (stuck
    //!     retention).
    //!
    //! ## How this test avoids being a restatement of the SQL
    //!
    //! The cleanup SQL embeds its roster inside a DELETE, so it cannot be read
    //! back directly. Rather than hand-copy an "equivalent" SELECT here — which
    //! would only ever prove *this file* agrees with *this file*, and would sit
    //! there passing while the DELETE drifted — the join chain is factored out of
    //! the DELETE into `channel_member_device_rows!` / `dm_member_device_rows!`
    //! and `concat!`-ed back in. The statements the DS executes are unchanged
    //! byte-for-byte (`the_extraction_did_not_change_the_cleanup_sql` pins that),
    //! and the SELECTs below are built from the SAME macro the DELETE is. There
    //! is exactly one copy of the roster SQL in the crate.
    //!
    //! So the drift this catches is the drift that matters: change the roster on
    //! either side — the JOIN inside the DELETE, or the query in
    //! `current_member_devices` — and the two sides disagree here. The expected
    //! rosters are additionally spelled out literally, so a change applied
    //! symmetrically to *both* implementations still fails rather than silently
    //! redefining the invariant.
    //!
    //! [`the_roster_is_what_the_delete_actually_gates_on`] closes the remaining
    //! gap between "the fragment" and "the statement": it proves the deletion
    //! outcome flips exactly on the watermark of a device the fragment lists, and
    //! does not move for devices it excludes.

mod admin_delete_visibility_tests {
    //! #693 / #661 — WS1: does the admin-delete tombstone reliably reach a
    //! caught-up recipient? This module isolates and RULES OUT the issue's
    //! candidate 1 (a read-after-write / `sent_at`-ordering visibility gap
    //! between the DS write connection and the recipient's read connection) at
    //! the envelope/watermark/tombstone layer, using the REAL DS write code
    //! (`apply_send_message`, `apply_advance_watermark`, `apply_delete_message`)
    //! and the EXACT fetch SQL that `pollis_core::commands::messages::ingest`
    //! runs.
    //!
    //! ## The scenario (`sealed_admin_delete_of_other_member_works`, stripped of MLS)
    //!
    //! bob sends; carol fetches (so she holds a copy) and reports her watermark;
    //! alice admin-deletes bob's message (envelope removed + `type='delete'`
    //! tombstone written); carol fetches again. The flaky assertion is that
    //! carol's second fetch *sees the tombstone*. Here we drive exactly that
    //! envelope/watermark/tombstone dance and assert carol's second fetch returns
    //! the tombstone — across every `sent_at` shape a client clock can produce,
    //! and across TWO DISTINCT CONNECTIONS of one shared libsql `Database`.
    //!
    //! ## Why two connections of one `Database` is the faithful model
    //!
    //! In the flows harness every `TestClient.remote_db` is a
    //! `RemoteDb::query_only_view()` of the in-process DS's own `RemoteDb` — an
    //! `Arc::clone` of ONE underlying libsql `Database` on ONE local WAL file
    //! (`harness.rs`, and `RemoteDb`'s doc-comment on why a second `Database` on
    //! the same file would NOT see the writer's rows promptly). Every
    //! `RemoteDb::conn()` is a fresh `db.connect()` on that shared handle. So the
    //! DS's write connection and carol's read connection are two connections of
    //! ONE `Database` — which is precisely what these tests use. If libsql gave no
    //! read-your-writes guarantee across such connections, the tombstone SELECT
    //! below would intermittently miss the just-written row; it never does.
    //!
    //! ## What this proves (and what it therefore leaves)
    //!
    //! The tombstone is ALWAYS written and ALWAYS visible to carol's next fetch at
    //! this layer. So #661's residual flake is NOT "the tombstone is never
    //! written / sorts under carol's watermark / isn't yet visible on her
    //! connection". By elimination it lives DOWNSTREAM, in the client's
    //! *application* of the fetched tombstone (`ingest.rs`) — candidate 2,
    //! "fetched but not applied". See the self-diagnosing instrumentation added to
    //! the flows test itself, which reports which case a live failure was.
