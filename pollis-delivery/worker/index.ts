// Cloudflare Worker front-door for the Pollis Delivery Service.
//
// The DS is a stateless axum binary (pollis-delivery/Dockerfile) — all state
// lives in Turso/R2. Here it runs as a single-instance Cloudflare Container
// fronted by a Durable Object: the Worker forwards every HTTP request to the
// container on :8788, and the DO gives us exactly one serialized instance
// (Pollis's single-writer-to-Turso invariant, #419/#420).
//
// Secrets: the container reads its config as OS env vars (TURSO_URL, LIVEKIT_*,
// R2_*, …). Those come from Wrangler Secrets Store bindings, which are async
// (`.get()`), so they cannot live in the static `envVars`. Instead we override
// `startAndWaitForPorts` to resolve them at boot and inject them as per-instance
// env vars before the container serves any traffic. Doppler -> Secrets Store is
// the single source of truth (see the deploy workflows).
import {
  Container,
  type ContainerStartConfigOptions,
} from "@cloudflare/containers";

// WHERE the DS container physically runs (#658).
//
// A Durable Object addressed by name is placed in the region nearest whoever
// FIRST instantiated it, and that placement is PERMANENT for the life of that
// object ID. `getContainer(binding, name)` — which this used to call — is exactly
// `binding.idFromName(name)` + `binding.get(id)` with no placement argument
// (@cloudflare/containers 0.3.7, dist/lib/utils.js), so placement was never
// configured: it was decided by whichever request happened to arrive first.
//
// That went badly in dev and well in prod, purely by luck. Measured from one IAD
// edge, same code and same image: prod `/version` ~47ms, dev ~287ms — a ~240ms
// long-haul round trip dev pays before touching anything. Add one Turso read over
// a per-request connection and dev's signed endpoints hit ~1.53s against prod's
// ~68ms, while the dev database itself answers in ~20ms when queried directly.
// The DB was never slow; the container was simply far from it.
//
// `enam` (eastern North America) matches the `aws-us-east-1` Turso primary that
// BOTH environments use. Pinning it makes prod's current good placement a
// declared property instead of an accident that a rename, a migration tag, or a
// deploy from the wrong hemisphere could silently re-roll.
const DS_LOCATION_HINT: DurableObjectLocationHint = "enam";

// `locationHint` is honoured ONLY when the object is first created — an existing
// object never migrates. So the hint below does NOT move either environment's
// current container; it decides where the object lands the next time one is
// created from scratch (new account, new namespace, a `migrations` class change,
// or a deliberate rename per the procedure below). That is the point: it stops
// prod's placement from being re-rolled by chance.
//
// The object name comes from the per-environment `DS_SINGLETON_NAME` var so an
// environment can be re-placed on its own. This is the fallback for a config that
// sets no var — prod's long-standing object.
//
// CHANGING AN ENVIRONMENT'S NAME RE-PLACES ITS CONTAINER, and must follow the
// staged procedure in docs/deployments.md. A bare rename was tried on 2026-08-06
// and took dev down:
//
//   Failed to start container: Maximum number of running container instances
//   exceeded. Try again later, or try configuring a higher value for max_instances
//
// A rename creates a SECOND durable object while `max_instances: 1` permits only
// one container instance. The outgoing object still held it, so the incoming one
// could never start and every request 500'd until traffic was routed back. The DO
// is stateless (no `ctx.storage` in this file; all DS state is in Turso) — the
// blocker is the instance cap, not data. Hence: raise the cap, switch the name,
// let the orphan idle past `sleepAfter` and release, then lower the cap again.
