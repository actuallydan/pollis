//! Wire DTOs for the inputs and outputs of the serve layer.

//! [`Bundle`] mirrors the frozen monitor-bundle contract that

//! (see `verifiable-log/README.md`). It is a pure serde shape — no Merkle or
//! proof logic lives here; that all stays in `verifiable_log`. We deserialize
//! the builder's JSON directly rather than taking a dependency on the builder
//! crate (which pulls in libSQL/tokio), keeping the serve layer light and the

//!
//! [`PublicKeyDoc`] and [`Manifest`] are the two non-artifact-shaped documents
//! the serve layer itself defines: the standalone public-key file and the
//! discovery manifest (`/v1/index.json`).

/// checks *before* it trusts anything else, so version skew is reported as version
/// skew and never mistaken for tampering (see [`crate::remote::gate_format_version`]
/// and `pollis-verify`).
///
/// Bumped on any **breaking** change to the served shape — a removed/renamed
/// manifest field, a deleted class of artifact, or a change to the leaf encoding
/// that a prior verifier cannot parse. It is *not* bumped for additive changes an
/// older verifier tolerates.

/// | 0 (implicit) | the pre-#701 shape: `index.json` carried a `conversations` list, the commit-log tree published precomputed `/verify/group/<id>` reports, and the commit leaf published a raw `conversation_id` / `sender_id`. A manifest with **no** `format_version` field is treated as version 0. |
/// | 2 | **#701**: `conversations` removed from the manifest, the precomputed `/verify/group/<id>` artifacts deleted, and the commit leaf moved to windowed pseudonyms. Lands at the #672 / #699 republish (the leaf is a frozen contract — see `verifiable_log_builder::CommitLeaf`). |
///
/// (Version 1 is skipped so the number lines up with the `sth:v2` STH contexts the
/// same republish introduces — one mental model, "everything went to v2 at the
/// republish", not two.)
///
/// A verifier accepts any served version **≤** this constant (older or equal — it
/// understands the shape) and rejects any version **greater** than it as
/// [`crate::error::ServeError::VersionSkew`] ("this verifier is too old for this
/// log — upgrade"). That is the mechanism that stops the *next* breaking wire
/// change from surfacing as a serde/verification error to an auditor who is merely
