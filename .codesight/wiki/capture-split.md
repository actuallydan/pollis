# Capture Helper Split (screen + webcam)

How Pollis captures the local screen for screen-share, and why capture
runs in a **per-platform helper subprocess** on Linux and macOS but
in-process on Windows. The same helper split also captures the **webcam**
(`--mode camera`) — see [Webcam capture](#webcam-capture---mode-camera).

Covers issues **#281** (Linux: no portal backend on Cinnamon/MATE/XFCE),
**#283** (macOS: uncatchable Objective-C throw from ScreenCaptureKit), and
**#394** (webcam over the same split).

## TL;DR

| Platform | Where capture runs | Mechanism | Why |
|----------|--------------------|-----------|-----|
| Linux (Wayland + portal) | `pollis-capture-linux` subprocess | xdg-desktop-portal ScreenCast + PipeWire | libpipewire can't co-link with libwebrtc+cpal+webkit2gtk |
| Linux (X11 session) | `pollis-capture-linux` subprocess | xcb + MIT-SHM + RandR | No ScreenCast portal backend exists on many DEs |
| Linux (Wayland, no portal backend) | n/a — structured error | — | Genuinely unsupported; surfaced distinctly from "denied" |
| macOS | `pollis-capture-macos` subprocess | ScreenCaptureKit (SCContentSharingPicker + SCStream) | An ObjC `@throw` from SCK is uncatchable from Rust and hard-kills the host process |
| Windows | in-process | `windows-capture` (WGC) | Clean in-proc linkage, no analogous hazard |

All three capture helpers / paths emit frames over **one shared wire
protocol** (`pollis-capture-proto`). The parent-process pipeline
(socket reader, even-dimension floor, libyuv ARGB→I420, LiveKit publish)
is identical regardless of where frames originate.

Two things this pipeline no longer does, both removed deliberately:

- **No FPS or resolution cap.** There was a 1080p/60fps defensive clamp; it is
  gone. Publishers send native capture resolution and native frame rate, because
  VP8 software encode of a 4K/144 Hz source costs ~30–50% of one core on any
  laptop we ship to. If that stops being true the answer is a user-facing setting
  (#300), not a hardcoded ceiling. The even-dimension floor that I420 4:2:0 chroma
  requires still happens per frame.
- **No 2-second stall heartbeat.** There is no "stalled" or "paused" concept in
  screenshare at all. An earlier watchdog emitted `LocalStalled`/`RemoteStalled`
  and a "Stream paused" overlay, which misrepresented ordinary idle capture (a
  static screen on Wayland) as a failure. When capture is idle we simply stop
  pushing frames; the viewer keeps showing the last painted frame, which is
  indistinguishable from a stream of unchanging ones.

## The shared protocol — `pollis-capture-proto`

A tiny, platform-free workspace crate: `pollis-capture-proto/src/lib.rs`.
It is the single definition of the Unix-socket frame protocol.

```
message := [ u8 type ][ u32 LE payload_len ][ payload ]

0x01 Format   payload = [u32 LE width][u32 LE height]
0x02 Frame    payload = [u32 w][u32 h][u32 stride][i64 ts_us][BGRx...]
0xFF Error    payload = utf-8 message
```

- Encoders: `encode_format`, `encode_frame_header`, `encode_error`,
  `write_msg`. Used by `pollis-capture-linux` and `pollis-capture-macos`.
- Decoder: `read_msg` — used by the parent in
  `pollis-core/src/commands/screenshare/` (both the initial Format
  read and the streaming reader task).
- Wire bytes are **unchanged** from the original hand-rolled
  encode/decode that lived separately in `pollis-capture-linux` and
  `screenshare.rs`; the refactor only centralized them. Round-trip
  tests pin the byte layout and opcodes.

Reused by: `pollis-capture-linux`, `pollis-capture-macos`, `pollis-core`.

## #281 — Linux: two backends, routed by session type

### Root cause

`pollis-capture-linux` used `ashpd` → xdg-desktop-portal's `ScreenCast`
interface. That interface needs a **DE-specific portal backend**.
GNOME/KDE/wlroots ship one; **Cinnamon/MATE/XFCE do not** —
`xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` does NOT implement ScreenCast. On Mint/Cinnamon
the portal call errors *before any picker UI*, and the old helper
collapsed "no backend / portal error" into the same path as "user
denied" → looked like "denied without a prompt". Kernel version is
irrelevant.

### Why not X11 grab everywhere

Under Wayland, XWayland gives X11 clients a **private root window**, not
the real composited screen. `XShm`/`XGetImage` against it returns black.
So this must be a **two-backend, session-type-routed** design — not a
DE-name switch (GNOME and KDE also ship X11 sessions, which a DE-name
switch would mis-route).

### Routing probe

Decided once at capture start, in `pollis-capture-linux/src/linux.rs`
(`probe_backend`):

1. **Session type**: `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` (`x11` / `wayland`), with
   `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` / `$DISPLAY` corroborating.
2. **Portal availability** (Wayland only): is
   `org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast` actually present (probed via
   `Screencast::available_source_types`)?

| Session | Portal ScreenCast | Backend |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Wayland | present | `Portal` — ashpd + PipeWire (unchanged) |
| X11 | (not probed) | `X11` — xcb/SHM/RandR |
| Wayland | absent | `Unsupported` — structured `0xFF` error |

The `Unsupported` case sends a `0xFF` with an `unsupported:` prefix; the
parent maps that to a new `ScreenShareEvent::LocalUnsupported` (distinct
from `LocalError`), and the frontend shows "your desktop environment has
no screen-sharing backend" — NOT "grant permission". The portal path's
deny-vs-error collapse was also split (cancel / unsupported / genuine
failure are now distinguished in `screenshare.rs`).

### v1 X11 backend (`pollis-capture-linux/src/x11.rs`)

Shippable, deliberately minimal:

- **xcb + MIT-SHM** (SHM is non-negotiable — plain `XGetImage` is
  unusably slow at 1080p).
- **RandR** enumeration: capture one monitor (RandR primary, else first
  active CRTC, else whole root), not the spanned root.
- No per-window consent picker — X11 has no consent model
  (monitor/full-screen only).
- v1 = **full-framebuffer SHM copy per tick** (correct; heavier on weak
  CPUs).
- Emits the exact shared protocol; the parent reader / libyuv / LiveKit
  path is untouched.

Pixel format: a 24/32-bpp TrueColor `ZPixmap` on a little-endian X
server is byte-order BGRX — exactly what the parent's `argb_to_i420`
expects. The backend rejects big-endian / non-24/32-bpp servers loudly
rather than ship miscolored frames.

#### X11 follow-up phases (OUT of v1, documented TODOs — not blockers)

- **Phase 2**: XDamage — copy only changed regions.
- **Phase 3**: cursor compositing via XFixes `GetCursorImage`.
- **Phase 4**: HiDPI / fractional scaling; multi-monitor edge geometry.

## #283 — macOS: SCK in a helper subprocess (Phase 2 only)

### Root cause

`screencapturekit` 2.x ships a buggy `PickerResult.init(filter:)` Swift
bridge that does `[filter valueForKey:@"includedDisplays"]` on
`SCContentFilter`, a class without that key. Every selection from the
system `SCContentSharingPicker` throws `NSUnknownKeyException` on
replayd's XPC queue. Rust `catch_unwind` does **not** catch an ObjC
`@throw` — it reaches `std::terminate` → `abort()`. Confirmed on macOS
14.7. **No system picker is used.** Pollis enumerates with
`SCShareableContent.current()` and renders its own picker — the
industry-standard path used by Slack, Discord, Zoom and OBS — which
never goes through the broken code.

The helper subprocess is still load-bearing as defense-in-depth: SCK
has shown it'll throw and any future throw site stays isolated to the
helper, never killing the host app.

### Layout

`pollis-capture-macos/` mirrors `pollis-capture-linux/`:

- `src/main.rs` — non-macOS stub + `mod macos`.
- `src/macos.rs` — connects to the parent socket, enumerates available
  displays + windows via `SCShareableContent`, sends the list back to
  the parent (`MSG_SOURCES`), waits for the parent's `MSG_SELECT`,
  builds an `SCContentFilter` from the chosen display/window, and runs
  the `SCStream`. The `SCStreamOutputTrait` frame handler packs BGRA
  (== little-endian ARGB == BGRx) into the shared protocol.
- **No `SCContentSharingPicker`.** The system picker's
  `PickerResult.init(filter:)` Swift bridge does
  `[filter valueForKey:@"includedDisplays"]` on a key
  `SCContentFilter` doesn't expose, throws `NSUnknownKeyException`,
  and kills the helper on **every** selection — confirmed on macOS
  14.7. The industry-standard answer (used by Slack, Discord, Zoom,
  OBS): enumerate via `SCShareableContent.current` and render an
  in-app picker. That's what Pollis does. Less Apple gloss, but
  works.
- Parent death watch: macOS has no `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`; the helper polls
  `getppid()` and exits if reparented to launchd.

### Packaging

The helper sidecar ships through the Tauri build pipeline:
- `src-tauri/tauri.macos.conf.json`: `externalBin`
  `binaries/pollis-capture-macos`, Developer-ID signed, **same team
  9JF7WWYMU2**.
- `src-tauri/build.rs` builds the per-OS helper crate and stages it at
  `src-tauri/binaries/<helper>-<triple>` automatically on every cargo
  build of the `pollis` crate. Skips when the file is already present so
  CI's pre-built Linux artifact (from ubuntu-24.04, PipeWire 1.0) is
  reused on the app job (ubuntu-22.04). No shell script wrapper — runs
  uniformly for `cargo check`, `tauri dev`, and `tauri build` on macOS
  and Linux. Windows is skipped (WGC is in-process).

### Picker UX

On macOS the picker is a Pollis component (`ScreenSharePicker.tsx`),
not the macOS system picker. It opens in-place inside the voice
channel view (no modal — project rule), showing a tabbed grid of
displays and windows. The user picks one, the frontend sends
`Selection` to the parked helper via `start_screen_share`, the helper
builds the `SCContentFilter` and starts the `SCStream`. Cancel returns
to the participant grid.

On Linux the system portal (`xdg-desktop-portal`) is the consent gate
and **is** the picker; on Windows the WGC picker plays the same role.
The frontend calls `enumerate_screen_sources` first and, if the
returned list is empty (the backend's signal that this platform
handles selection itself), goes straight to `start_screen_share(null)`.

### Wire protocol (macOS extension)

`pollis-capture-proto` carries two extra message types just for the
macOS picker handshake:

- `MSG_SOURCES (0x03)` helper → parent: JSON `SourceList` of the
  enumerated displays + windows.
- `MSG_SELECT (0x04)` parent → helper: JSON `Selection` —
  `{kind: "display" | "window", id: <CGDirectDisplayID | CGWindowID>}`.

Linux helpers never send `MSG_SOURCES` and never read `MSG_SELECT`.
The same opcodes are reserved in the proto crate so both helpers
share one wire format definition.

## Renderer publish path (removed)

There was once an Electron-only path where capture + encode + publish
happened entirely in the renderer via `getDisplayMedia` +
`livekit-client` (`frontend/src/screenshare/livekitView.ts`), bypassing
the Rust helper pipeline. It only ran under Chromium's WebRTC, and the
shipping shell is Tauri (WebKitGTK has no WebRTC), so it was always dead
code on the real build. It — along with the `livekit-client` frontend
dependency (~490 KiB) and its E2EE worker — was **removed** (#431): the
Rust helper pipeline described above is the only screen-share path.

## Webcam capture (`--mode camera`)

The same helper-split infrastructure also captures the **local webcam** for
a third video track published into the active voice room
(`TrackSource::Camera`, alongside mic + screen share). Room-level E2EE
encrypts it automatically — no camera-specific crypto. PR #394.

### How it reuses the split

Each capture helper takes a `--mode {screen|camera}` flag (clap). `screen`
(default) is everything above; `camera` drives a webcam:

| Platform | Camera mechanism | Status |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| macOS | `pollis-capture-macos --mode camera` — AVFoundation `AVCaptureSession` + `AVCaptureVideoDataOutput` (32BGRA) | done |
| Linux | `pollis-capture-linux --mode camera` — V4L2 (`v4l` crate), MJPG (zune-jpeg) or YUYV → BGRx | done |
| Windows | **in-process** (no helper) — Media Foundation `IMFSourceReader` with the Video Processor enabled → RGB32 (== BGRx); mirrors WGC screen capture | done |

**No display-server split on Linux.** Unlike screen capture (portal vs
xcb/SHM, routed by session type), webcam capture has *one* path: V4L2 is a
kernel API, identical under X11, Wayland, and headless. The camera mode in
`linux.rs` skips `probe_backend()` entirely. (A Flatpak/Snap sandbox would
need the camera *portal*; native Pollis isn't sandboxed, so direct
`/dev/videoN` access — the Discord/Zoom native convention — is correct.)

### Camera handshake (proto extension)

Two more message types, mirroring the macOS screen picker handshake:

- `MSG_CAMERAS (0x05)` helper → parent: JSON `CameraList` — every
  capture device the OS reports (no virtual-camera filtering). Linux lists
  each `/dev/videoN` that advertises `VIDEO_CAPTURE` *and* a pixel format
  (drops the metadata-only sibling nodes UVC cams expose).
- `MSG_SELECT_CAMERA (0x06)` parent → helper: JSON `CameraSelection` —
  the opaque per-platform device id (macOS `AVCaptureDevice.uniqueID`,
  Linux V4L2 node path), echoed back verbatim.

Lifecycle (all platforms): helper connects → `Cameras` → parent shows the
in-app picker (or auto-picks when there's one device) → `SelectCamera` →
`Format` → `Frame…`. Camera frames reuse the unchanged `Format`/`Frame`
messages — every helper delivers **BGRx**, so the parent's `convert_to_i420`
+ LiveKit publish is shared with the screen path.

### Linux pixel-format policy (`pollis-capture-linux/src/camera.rs`)

Prefers **MJPG** (the only HD format many UVC cams expose; some are
MJPG-only), decoded to RGB with `zune-jpeg`, then packed BGRx. Falls back to
raw **YUYV** (4:2:2), converted in-process via BT.601. H.264 is ignored
(heavy decode, every UVC cam also offers MJPG/YUYV). Negotiates 1280×720 by
default; the driver adjusts and we publish whatever it gives. Verified at
**32 fps** (release) against an EMEET SmartCam S600.

### Parent + frontend (`camera/` modules)

- **Parent**: `pollis-core/src/commands/camera/` — `capture.rs` is the
  helper-socket path (talks only the socket protocol; `locate_capture_helper`
  picks the per-OS helper), gated `any(macos, linux)`. Windows captures
  in-process in `start_windows.rs` (Media Foundation, no helper — the same
  divergence WGC screen capture takes); mobile/other get `unsupported.rs`.
  All three expose the same lifecycle: `list_video_devices` / `start_camera` /
  `stop_camera`, events via `CameraEvent` (`local_started/stopped/error`). The
  Windows path reuses the shared `convert_to_i420` + `pack_frame_bytes` codec
  primitives and the `LOCAL_CAMERA_PREVIEW_KEY` self-preview mirroring.
- **Local self-preview**: the reader task mirrors each outgoing frame
  (throttled) to the renderer over the *same* frame WebSocket screen share
  uses, under `LOCAL_CAMERA_PREVIEW_KEY` (distinct from screen share's
  `LOCAL_PREVIEW_KEY`).
- **Remote camera**: every remote video track flows through the one shared
  `on_remote_video_subscribed` drain + frame WS. The voice room loop reads
  the publication's `TrackSource` and tags `ScreenShareEvent::RemoteStarted`
  with a `source` (`screen` | `camera`); the renderer routes the track_key
  to the participant's camera axis (`appStore.cameraRemotes`) vs its
  screenshare axis (`participant.video`). The Tauri renderer has no JS LiveKit
  client, so this tag is the only thing that distinguishes them.
- **Two tiles, not one (#394)**: camera and screenshare are independent axes
  that coexist, so a participant publishing both renders as **two separate
  tiles** — a camera tile and a screenshare tile. `VoiceStage`'s `tilesFor`
  expands each participant into up to two `StageTileModel`s
  (`none→[audio] / camera→[camera] / screen→[screenshare] / both→[camera,
  screenshare]`); `StageTile.media` is a `audio | camera | screenshare`
  discriminated union so a tile carries exactly one surface (the old
  "camera-as-tile-face, dropped when screensharing" state is unrepresentable).
  Camera and screenshare tiles are treated identically at the container level —
  both spotlightable, fullscreenable, and carrying the res·fps badge; the
  container doesn't care where the pixels come from. The `:cam`/`:screen` tile
  key suffix (not the badge) is what tells the two apart. When both a camera and
  a screenshare are present, the screenshare takes the default spotlight.
- **Frontend**: `camera/cameraSession.ts` (event subscription + lifecycle,
  reuses `screenShareSession`'s frame router), `camera/cameraActions.ts`
  (`toggleCamera`), `components/Voice/CameraPicker.tsx` (in-app picker, bar
  pattern), camera toggle in `VoiceBar` + the stage tray, and the camera tile
  in `StageTile`/`VoiceStage`. MobX `CameraState` union mirrors `ShareState`.

## Parent-side pipeline (unchanged, shared by all paths)

`pollis-core/src/commands/screenshare/`:

- `enumerate_screen_sources` (macOS) — binds a Unix socket, spawns the
  helper, reads the `MSG_SOURCES` list, parks the helper in
  `picker_session` waiting for the upcoming `Select`, returns the
  list to the frontend.
- `cancel_screen_share_picker` — kills a parked picker helper when the
  user backs out of the in-app picker without selecting.
- `start_screen_share(selection)` — reuses the parked picker helper if
  present (macOS) or spawns a fresh helper (Linux portal path). On
  macOS sends `MSG_SELECT` with the user's pick, then reads `Format`
  from the same helper. Linux skips the Select (no such message). On
  both, creates the LiveKit `NativeVideoSource` + track, publishes,
  spawns the reader task.
- Reader task — `read_msg` loop: FPS cap, `convert_and_cap`
  (libyuv ARGB→I420 + 1080p downscale), `source.capture_frame`,
  self-preview, 2 s stall heartbeat.
- `stop_screen_share` — Linux + macOS share one teardown: abort the
  reader task, kill the helper (killing the macOS helper IS the SCK
  stop + picker deactivate, since SCK now lives entirely in it).

## Shared audio (#884)

A screen share can carry the source's sound. It is a **second LiveKit
track**, published alongside the video with `TrackSource::ScreenshareAudio`
— never mixed into the microphone track, and never routed through the
microphone's APM. The invariant is enforced by
`pollis-core/tests/shared_audio_never_reaches_the_mic.rs`.

Opt-in, off by default (Slack/Discord/Zoom convention). The choice reaches
the two helpers by different routes, because the platforms differ in when
they can hear it:

- **macOS** — carried on `Selection::with_audio`. The helper is spawned
  during `enumerate_screen_sources`, before the user has seen the picker,
  so `Select` is the first moment it can be told.
- **Linux** — passed as `--audio` at spawn. There is no `Select` at all:
  the xdg-desktop-portal dialog is the picker.
- **Windows** — in-process, no helper involved.

### What each platform actually captures

| OS | Backend | Scope | Own audio excluded by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | ScreenCaptureKit `capturesAudio` | The **content filter** — a window shares that app's audio, a display shares the system mix | `excludesCurrentProcessAudio` |
| Linux | PipeWire, `stream.capture.sink` | Whole system (default sink monitor) | `screenshare::self_echo` (software AEC) |
| Windows | WASAPI process loopback | Whole system, minus our process tree | `PROCESS_LOOPBACK_MODE_EXCLUDE_TARGET_PROCESS_TREE` |

The picker states the scope in one line when the toggle is on, because
"share sound" genuinely means something different per OS.

### Excluding ourselves is the load-bearing part

During a call, whatever the machine is playing **includes the call**. A
naive capture re-publishes every remote participant's voice back to them a
few hundred milliseconds late — which is why the first attempt at Linux
screenshare audio was pulled under #175 and left a note in
`pollis-capture-linux/src/linux.rs` for years.

macOS and Windows exclude our process at the OS. Linux has no equivalent:
the sink monitor is a mix, so by the time we can read it our contribution
is already summed in. It is removed instead by **subtraction**, in
`pollis-core/src/commands/screenshare/self_echo.rs`:

```
voice mixer 10 ms mix ──→ analyze_render ─┐
                                          ├─→ AEC ──→ published shared audio
sink-monitor loopback ──→ run_capture ────┘
```

The render reference is the voice mixer's own output — the exact signal
about to hit the speaker — parked in `VoiceState::shared_audio_render` so
the mixer can find it across an output-device switch. The echo path is a
pure digital loopback (linear, no room, no speaker distortion), so AEC3
converges far better here than on the microphone. **AEC only**: NS and AGC
are tuned for speech and would wreck music, which is most of what people
share sound for.

Windows deliberately has **no fallback** to plain endpoint loopback on
builds older than Windows 10 20H1: `webrtc-audio-processing` has no MSVC
build, so the software canceller is a stub there, and shipping a known
echo is worse than shipping silence — the person it breaks the call for is
not the person who turned it on. Those machines share video and report
audio unavailable.

### Wire + publish path

`pollis-capture-proto` gains `0x07 AudioFormat { sample_rate, channels }`
and `0x08 AudioFrame { sample_rate, channels, timestamp_us, i16 PCM }`.
The parent normalises every platform's shape to one thing in
`screenshare/audio.rs`: **downmix to mono → resample to 48 kHz → rebuffer
to exact 10 ms frames**. Mono is not a compromise — the receiving mixer
folds every remote track to mono anyway, so stereo would cost double the
bandwidth for an identical result.

`AudioFormat` is what triggers the publish, not the user's request: the
track appears only once a backend has actually announced a source, so no
viewer sees a speaker icon for a track that never carries a sample.

### Failure is a downgrade, never a teardown

A helper reports an audio-only problem through the same `0xFF Error`
channel it uses for fatal capture failures, distinguished by an `audio:`
prefix (`audio::audio_error_message`). The parent emits
`LocalAudioUnavailable` and **keeps the video share running**. A laptop
with no output device, a PipeWire-less session, or a pre-20H1 Windows box
still shares its screen.

`ScreenShareEvent` gains `LocalAudioStarted` and `LocalAudioUnavailable`;
`ShareState.active` gains `audio: ShareAudioState`
(`off | pending | live | unavailable`), shown as an indicator — not a
control — in `VoiceBar`. Audio cannot be toggled mid-share, because the
capture cannot be renegotiated without restarting it.

**Mid-share audio loss retires the track (#1040).** An `audio:` error
after the track is already published — or, on Windows, the WASAPI thread
hanging up while the share is still active — runs
`audio::unpublish_shared_audio`: `retire_shared_audio` takes the
track + source out of `ScreenShareState` and disarms the self-echo tap,
then the track is unpublished before the source is dropped (the same
order `stop` uses). Without that, every viewer kept a lit speaker
indicator on a track carrying no samples until the share ended, and the
voice mixer kept feeding a canceller nothing was reading. The renderer
sees the same `LocalAudioUnavailable` it already handles, and a later
`AudioFormat` (device came back) republishes from scratch. The state
transition is pinned by `retiring_shared_audio_*` in `audio.rs`; the
unpublish itself needs a live `Room`, so it is verified by hand — pull
the output device under a Linux share and confirm the viewer's speaker
icon goes out.

### Receiving side

Shared audio arrives as an ordinary remote audio track and mixes to the
speaker like one. The publication's `TrackSource` is the only thing that
distinguishes it, and `voice/lifecycle.rs` reads it to pass
`is_shared_audio` into `register_remote_track`: such a track is **excluded
from speaking detection and the level meter**, or a shared video would
show the sharer talking continuously for its whole runtime.

E2EE needs nothing new. Encryption is configured at the room
(`RoomOptions::encryption`, keyed from the MLS exporter secret), so
libwebrtc's `FrameCryptor` attaches to every track the participant
publishes and rotates on every epoch advance. Shared audio is ciphertext
to the SFU on exactly the same terms as the microphone.

### Linux settings note

Linux never shows the in-app picker, so it has nowhere to put a toggle.
The choice lives in a stored preference (`screen_share_audio`, Voice
settings) which the Linux start path reads directly and which seeds the
picker's toggle on the other two platforms.
