//! THE UI e2e GATE: a headless, in-process, two-client scenario that drives the
//! REAL ratatui state machine (keystrokes → `App::on_key` → `App::run` →
//! `ui::render`) against a `TestBackend`, and proves a message typed on one
//! client's UI surfaces on the OTHER client's RENDERED screen.
//!
//! This closes the gap the `*_smoke.rs` tests leave open: they exercise only the
//! library core (`auth`/`data`/`send`/`sync`/`enroll`) and never touch
//! `app.rs`/`ui.rs`. Here the send AND the receive-surfacing both go through the
//! real UI, and every assertion is on visible RENDERED text (`buffer_text`), not
//! model state — that is what makes this a UI e2e rather than another core smoke.
//!
//! ## What goes through the real UI vs. the core
//! - Through the UI: signup (Email → OTP → PIN screens), opening the DM,
//!   composing + sending a message, and the receive-surfacing (Refresh → render).
//! - Through the core command layer: establishing DM MEMBERSHIP (create + accept).
//!   Wiring the full start-DM prompt + accept handshake through the UI is
//!   disproportionately fiddly for a first test (it needs username resolution and
//!   a synced pending-request row on the peer); the smokes establish membership
//!   the same way. The SEND + RECEIVE path — the point of this test — is 100% UI.
//!
//! Determinism: no fixed unconditional sleep is the mechanism of correctness. The
//! background sync loop runs at a short cadence and surfacing is asserted with the
//! bounded poll-until-visible `Driver::wait_for`.
