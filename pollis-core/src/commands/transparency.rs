//! Account-key transparency: client-side self-audit and peer audit.
//!
//! This is the *client* half of the account-key tenant (issue #330). The log,
//! its signed Merkle tree, and the per-user `/verify/account/<id>` reports are
//! produced server-side and audited by the `pollis-verify` CLI; here we let the
//! running app perform the same verification for its OWN key and for a peer it
//! has TOFU-pinned (see [`crate::commands::safety`]) — reusing the EXACT shared
//! verifier the auditor uses ([`verifiable_log_serve::account::verify_account`])
//! so a client can never reach a different verdict than a third-party auditor.
//! No proof, Merkle, or signature logic is reimplemented here.
//!
//! **Pinned trust root.** The log's Ed25519 public key is pinned as a constant
//! ([`PINNED_LOG_PUBLIC_KEY`]). The served `public_key.json` MUST equal it; a
//! mismatch is a hard [`AuditStatus::Alarm`], never a warning — without the pin
//! a hostile host could serve its own key over its own self-consistent (but
//! forged) tree and every signature would "verify".
//!
//! **What lives here.** Only *status derivation* — comparing the verified
//! published chain against this device's local view of the key. That decision
//! is factored into pure functions ([`derive_self_audit`], [`derive_peer_audit`])
//! so it is unit-testable with no HTTP and no DB. Everything network/proof-shaped
//! goes through the shared verifier.
//!
//! **Policy: advisory, never blocking.** Every status is informational. The app
//! keeps working regardless; an `Alarm` raises the alert, it does not stop a
//! send. `Unavailable` means "couldn't check" (host down), not "failed".
