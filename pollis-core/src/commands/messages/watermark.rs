//! The delivery-watermark computation — extracted as a pure, generic free
//! function so it can be (1) exercised by the real ingest path and (2) proved
//! by Kani over symbolic inputs.
//!
//! ## What this decides (the safety property)
//!
//! During interleaved catch-up ([`super::ingest`]) each conversation gets a new
//! watermark: an EXCLUSIVE `sent_at` cursor that the next fetch uses as
//! `sent_at > watermark`. Advancing this cursor past an envelope means "never
//! fetch it again". So the cursor MUST NOT advance to or past any envelope we
//! still have to retry (an MLS message whose epoch this pass never reached) —
//! otherwise a current member permanently loses a decryptable message (failure
//! class F3; the exact property #442 was a false alarm about).
//!
//! The rule, preserved verbatim from the original inline logic:
//! * `stop_at` = the `sent_at` of the FIRST un-handled envelope (in the given,
//!   `sent_at`-ordered, slice order).
//! * the candidate loop walks the slice and adopts each `sent_at` as the running
//!   watermark, but BREAKS as soon as it reaches an envelope with
//!   `sent_at >= stop_at`. The `>=` (not `>`) is deliberate: on a `sent_at`
//!   tie between a handled and an un-handled envelope the cursor must stop
//!   STRICTLY BELOW the shared timestamp, or the next `sent_at > watermark`
//!   fetch would skip the un-handled one. The watermark is therefore always
//!   strictly less than the first un-handled `sent_at`, even on a tie.
//!
//! The Kani harnesses at the bottom of this file prove exactly that (P1), plus
//! monotonicity (P2) and handled-liveness (P3). Each proof is paired with a
//! deliberately-broken mutant harness (`p{1,2,3}_mutant_refuted`, all
//! `#[kani::should_panic]`) demonstrating that proof still has teeth.

/// The only distinction the watermark cares about: whether an envelope's
/// deliverability is gated on reaching its MLS epoch this pass.
///
/// `Message` / `Edit` carry an MLS epoch and are epoch-gated (handled only once
/// the shared group's replay reached — or provably can never reach — their
